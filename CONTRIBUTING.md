# Contributing to passenger-docker

First off, thank you for considering contributing to passenger-docker. It's people like you that make Open Source a great place to be. Now let's make sure your contribution gets merged!

### Contributions we happily welcome
We look for contributions improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials, as well as bug reports and patches.

### Contributions we are not looking for
Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Instead [consider Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&q=passenger%20docker).

## Ground Rules

### Your first contribution
Not sure what you can help us out with? Check our [list of issues and feature requests](https://github.com/phusion/passenger-docker/issues) first.

#### Is this your first contribution to Open Source?

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

### How to submit a contribution
Please follow the steps below to make your contribution to passenger-docker.

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone or download the repository
3. Write your code
4. Push your code and create a Pull Request
5. Wait patiently while we review your changes
6. Party :tada:

### Found a security flaw?
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Please send an email to info@phusion.nl instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
  * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
  * Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue.

### How to file a bug report
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What does your software stack look like?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do? :scream:
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

## Code review process
passenger-docker is semi-regularly released, often in conjunction with a [Passenger](https://github.com/phusion/passenger/) release.

## Community
passenger-docker is a Phusion Passenger project. [Theaxiom](https://github.com/Theaxiom) took over the role of core maintainer.
